```
> This is a boilerplate app with minimal styling
> Consists of simple routing, and both client and server side auth
```

#### The format of this boilerplate came from the work of [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/StephenGrider/)

```
> Specifically, his React + Redux courses on Udemy. I've updated the original starter files and refactored them to utilize the latest versions of all packages, and meet my preferences.
